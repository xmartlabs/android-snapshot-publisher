### Changes
#### Firebase app distribution migration
Google deprecated and migrated [Fabric Craslytics Beta](https://get.fabric.io/roadmap) to [Firebase app distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution).  
The [documentation](README.md#firebase-app-distribution) specifies the required changes to use the new tool. 

Migration:

Change plugin dependency setup:
- Version 1x:
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' } // Remove it
  }
  dependencies {
     classpath "com.xmartlabs:snapshot-publisher:1.0.4" // Replace version
  }
}
```
- Version 2x:
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
    google() // Add it
  }
  dependencies {
     classpath "com.xmartlabs:snapshot-publisher:2.0.0" // Replace version
  }
}
```

Change the previous `fabric` block to the new `firebaseAppDistribution` block:

- Version 1x:
```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    fabric {
        distributionEmails = "mail@xmartlabs.com"
        distributionGroupAliases = "tester-group"
        distributionNotifications = true // Must be deleted
    }
    // ...
}
```

- Version 2x:
```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    firebaseAppDistribution {
        distributionEmails =  "mail@xmartlabs.com"
        distributionGroupAliases = "tester-group"
        appId = null // New parameter
        serviceAccountCredentials = "/path/to/your-service-account-key.json" // new parameter
    }
    // ...
}
```
- `appId`: Your app's Firebase App ID.
Required only if you don't have the google services gradle plugin installed.
You can find the App ID in the google-services.json file or in the Firebase console on the General Settings page.
The value in your build.gradle file overrides the value output from the google-services gradle plugin.
- `serviceAccountCredentials`: The path to your service account private key JSON file.
To release to Firebase you must create a Google service account with Firebase Quality Admin role.
If you don't have a service account, you can create one following [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution/android/distribute-gradle#authenticate_using_a_service_account).

### Breaking changes
- Fabric Craslytics Beta integration was removed
- Google Play's service credential account file path was changed to a credential file path.

Migration:
- Version 1x:
```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    googlePlay {
       serviceAccountCredentials = file("/path/to/your-service-account-key.json")
    }
    // ...
}
```
- version 2x:
```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    googlePlay {
       serviceAccountCredentials = "/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Breaking changes

These values are built by joining all `emails` or `aliases` with commas.
