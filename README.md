Android Snapshot Publisher is a Gradle plugin to **prepare and distribute Android Snapshot versions** to multiple distribution sources in a simple and common way.
Check out our [Introducing Android Snapshot Plugin blog post](https://blog.xmartlabs.com/2019/04/18/Introducing-Android-Snapshot-Publisher/) to see what inspired us to build it as well as a brief description of the plugin's main features and how to get started with it. 

The main features of the **preparation process** are:
- Update the Android Version Name to keep track of the distributed versions.
The default behavior adds the commit identifier to the Android Version name.
It's very helpful to track possible issues, for example if a crash occurs, you'll want to know in which snapshot version of the app it happened.
- Create and customize rich release notes based on git's history.

As an example, the following is an automated release note generated by this project.
```text

## Installation

The plugin is hosted in the Gradle Plugin Portal.
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }
  }
  dependencies {
     classpath "com.xmartlabs:snapshot-publisher:1.0.2"
  }
}
```
Apply the plugin to each individual `com.android.application` module where you want to use it.

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.xmartlabs.snapshot-publisher'
```

> Note that Fabric's Maven Repository must be added to the project because Android Snapshot Publisher plugin uses Fabric's plugin and it's hosted in their Maven Repository.

## Setup
The plugin defines a `snapshotPublisher` block where you can add the different setup alongside the Android modules.

```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    version {
        // Version customization
    }
    releaseNotes {
        // Release notes customization
    }
    fabric {
        // Fabric Beta setup
    }
    googlePlay {
        // Google Play setup
    }
}
```
The [version](#version-customization) and [releaseNotes](#release-notes) blocks are used to perform the preparation process.
Whereas [fabric](#fabric-beta) and [googlePlay](#google-play) blocks are used to perform the distribution process.

### Version customization
The `version` block allows you to perform version customizations.
The field in that block is optional and its default value is:

```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    version {
        versionNameFormat = '{currentVersionName}-{commitHash}'
    }
    // ...
}
```

- `versionNameFormat` defines the Android Version Name for the delivered build.
    The default value is the current version name and the short-hash commit, joined by a hyphen.
    
    The possible variables for this value are:
    - `{currentVersionName}`: The current version name.
    - `{commitHash}`: The current git commit hash, in the short format.
    - `{branchName}`: The current git branch name.

    This value can be updated using these optional variables.
    For example, if you want to keep the current version name and the hash commit and add a custom suffix such as `-SNAPSHOT`, you must assign the value `'{currentVersionName}-{commitHash}-SNAPSHOT'` to the `versionNameFormat` variable.

### Release notes
The `releaseNotes` block allows you to perform build release notes customizations.
All fields in that block are optional and their default values are:

```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    releaseNotes {
        releaseNotesFormat = """{version}: {header}
{history}
"""
        versionFormat = '{versionName}'
        headerFormat = '%s%n%nAuthor: %an <%ae>'
        historyFormat = '\nLast Changes:\n{commitHistory}'
        commitHistoryFormat = '• %s (%an - %ci)'
        maxCommitHistoryLines = 10
        includeLastCommitInHistory = false
        includeMergeCommitsInHistory = true
        includeHistorySinceLastTag = false
        outputFile = null
    }
    // ...
}
```

> Note: you can test the generated release notes executing the `generateSnapshotReleaseNotes` gradle task and if you also add the `--info` flag you will see them in the command's output.

- `releaseNotesFormat`: Defines the format of the release notes:
    The possible variables to play with in this case are:
    - [`{version}`](#version) given by `versionFormat`.
    - [`{header}`](#header) given by `headerFormat`.
    By default it contains information about the most recent commit and their author.
    - [`{history}`](#history) given by `historyFormat`.
    It contains information about the most recent history of the build.

#### Version
It contains information about the build version.
- `versionFormat`: Specifies the version's variable format.
    
    `{versionName}` (Android app's Version Name) and `{versionCode}` (Android app's Version Code) can be used to create it.

#### Header
It contains information about the most recent commit.

- `headerFormat`: Specifies the header's variable format.
The plugin uses [Git's pretty format] to retrieve the information about the current commit.
If you want to modify this, you may want to use it.

#### History
It contains information about the most recent commits, starting from the last -not current- commit to `maxCommitHistoryLines` commits before that.
If you want to include the last commit in that range, you can set `includeLastCommitInHistory` as `true`.
The format of these commits is given by `commitHistoryFormat`.
This section is shown only if there is at least one commit history.

- `historyFormat`: Specifies the history's variable format. 
It contains the `{commitHistory}`, which is given by the result of applying `commitHistoryFormat` to a certain range of commits of commits.

- `commitHistoryFormat`: Specifies the `{commitHistory}` variable format.
As `headerFormat` does, it uses [Git's pretty format] to create the `commitHistory` for the previous commits.

- `maxCommitHistoryLines`: Indicates the number of commits included in `{commitHistory}`.

- `includeLastCommitInHistory`: Flag to include the most recent commit in `{commitHistory}`.
By default this value is `false` because it's used in `{header}`

- `includeMergeCommitsInHistory`: Flag to include merge commits in `{commitHistory}`.

- `includeHistorySinceLastTag`: Indicates the history start point.
By default it's `false`, which means that all commits are used to get the history.
However, if its value is `true`, only the commits after the previous tag will be included in the build history.
The previous tag is the latest tag before the current commit.
This is useful if you want to include in the history only the changes after the previous release.

#### Other

- `outputFile`: The file where the release notes will be saved.
By default this value is `null` and that means the release notes will be generated and delivered with the snapshot build but it will not be saved in the file system.
If you want to save the release notes in the file system, you can set `outputFile = file("release-notes.txt")`.
You can define it using a relative path (where the start point is the Android application module folder) or an absolute path.


### Fabric Beta
This block defines the configuration needed to deploy the artifacts in Fabric's Beta.
This plugin uses [Fabric's beta plugin](https://docs.fabric.io/android/beta/gradle.html), so to be able to release you must have added the Fabric `ApiKey` in the application manifest and the `apiSecret` in the `fabric.properties` file.
For more information about it, you can read [Fabric's setup guide](https://docs.fabric.io/android/fabric/settings/api-keys.html#).

All of the block's fields are optional:

```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    fabric {
        distributionEmails = ""
        distributionGroupAliases = ""
        distributionNotifications = true
    }
    // ...
}
```

- `distributionEmails`: The list of email addresses of those who'll get the release.
This value is built by joining all emails with commas.
For example if you want to distribute the build to `email1@mail.com` and `email2@mail.com`, `distributionEmails` value should be `"email1@mail.com,email2@mail.com"`.
- `distributionGroupAliases`: The list of names (aliases) of the groups defined inside Fabric's Beta that will get the release.
As well as `distributionEmails`, all aliases must be joined by commas.
- `distributionNotifications`: If set to `true`, all build's recipients will get an email notification about the release.

> Note: Fabric's Beta limits your release notes to a maximum of 16384 characters.
Because of that, the plugin trims them up to the last allowed line.

### Google Play

This block defines the configuration needed to deploy the artifacts in Google Play.
This plugin uses [Gradle Play Publisher](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher).

```groovy
snapshotPublisher {
    googlePlay {
       serviceAccountCredentials = file("your-key.json")
       track = "internal"
       releaseStatus = "completed"
       defaultToAppBundles = false
       resolutionStrategy = "auto"
    }
    // ...
}
```

The only required field is `serviceAccountCredentials`.
To release to Google Play you must create a service account with access to the Play Developer API.
You can [follow the CodePath guide "Automating Publishing to the Play Store"](https://guides.codepath.com/android/automating-publishing-to-the-play-store).

- `serviceAccountCredentials`: contains the service account JSON file with your private key.
- `track`: refers to the Google play tracks. For example, some possible tracks are `internal`, `alpha`, `beta` and `production`.
- `releaseStatus`: the type of the release. The possible values are `completed`, `draft`, `inProgress`, `halted`.
- `defaultToAppBundles`: if set to `true`, the plugin will generate an [App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/) instead of an APK.  
- `resolutionStrategy`: defines the strategy that will take place if a build with the same version code already exists in Google Play (this will throw an error). 
The possible values are `ignore` (it will ignore the error and continue) and `auto` (it will automatically increase the version code for you).

> Note: Google's PlayStore limits your release notes to a maximum of 500 characters.
Because of that, the plugin trims them up to the last allowed line.

## How to use it?

The plugin defines some tasks that can be run.
The naming convention is as follows: `[action][Variant][BuildType]`. For example, `publishSnapshotGooglePlayStagingRelease` will be generated if the app has a `staging` flavor and `release` build type.

To find available tasks, run `./gradlew tasks` and look under the "Snapshot Publishing" section.

The most important tasks are:
- `publishSnapshotFabric[Variant][BuildType]`: it'll publish a snapshot version in Fabric's Beta.   
- `publishSnapshotGooglePlay[Variant][BuildType]`: it'll publish a snapshot version in Google Play.

Some auxiliary tasks are:
- `generateSnapshotReleaseNotes[Variant][BuildType]`: Generates the release notes file.
- `updateAndroidVersionName[Variant][BuildType]`: Changes the app version name to use the version name defined in the `version` configuration's block.
- `prepareApkSnapshotBuild[Variant][BuildType]`: Prepares the snapshot build and creates an apk version.
- `prepareBundleSnapshotBuild[Variant][BuildType]`: Prepares the snapshot build and creates a bundle version.

> Note: Google's PlayStore doesn't allow to upload `debuggable` builds, so `debuggable` build types' gradle tasks are not generated.
