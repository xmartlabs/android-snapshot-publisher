Thanks for using Snapshot Publisher! Before you post an issue, please consider the following points:

  - [ ] Check if the issue was [already reported or fixed](https://github.com/xmartlabs/snapshot-publisher/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

  - [ ] Please include the library version number, including the minor and patch version, in the issue text. In addition, if you'd include the major version in the title (such as `1.x`) that would be great.

  - [ ] If you think you found a bug, please include a code sample that reproduces the problem. Dumping a stacktrace is usually not enough for us.
